## Next Event

**05/05/2020** 1800 - 2100 (Location TBC)

**Title**: Malware Threat Analysis and Intelligence Recon ‚Äì Trickbot

**Speaker**: [Chris Young](https://twitter.com/__shabab__)

**Bio**: Chris is an information security consultant with Pentest Ltd.  Despite his youthful looks, Chris is old enough to remember the birth of Internet, dialling into AOL and running amok in #IRC Channels. Late to Infosec party - Chris changed career from Learning Technology to Security in 2016 after completing a MSc in Information & Network Security.

**Description**: This presentation will provide you with some information on each of the Malware threats that I like to call ‚Äúthe 3 amigos‚Äù ‚Äì Emotet, Trickbot and RYUK.  I then focus in on Trickbot and the different types of modules that it uses.  I also examine the ecosystems that attackers use to spread their malware. Additionally, I will provide some useful links for anyone thinking of getting started in malware analysis. Not a super technical talk so no reverse engineering skills required! üòä
