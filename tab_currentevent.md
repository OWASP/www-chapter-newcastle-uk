## Next Event

**05/05/2020** 1800 - 2100 (Location TBC)

**Title**: Malware Threat Analysis and Intelligence Recon – Trickbot

**Speaker**: [Chris Young](https://twitter.com/__shabab__)

**Bio**: Chris is an information security consultant with Pentest Ltd.  Despite his youthful looks, Chris is old enough to remember the birth of Internet, dialling into AOL and running amok in #IRC Channels. Late to Infosec party - Chris changed career from Learning Technology to Security in 2016 after completing a MSc in Information & Network Security.

**Description**: This presentation will provide you with some information on each of the Malware threats that I like to call “the 3 amigos” – Emotet, Trickbot and RYUK.  I then focus in on Trickbot and the different types of modules that it uses.  I also examine the ecosystems that attackers use to spread their malware. Additionally, I will provide some useful links for anyone thinking of getting started in malware analysis. Not a super technical talk so no reverse engineering skills required! 😊

**Title**: Alice Through the Cyber Looking Glass

**Speaker**: [Rick Trotter](https://twitter.com/the_gingercoder)

**Bio**: Rick Trotter is one of the last Generation-X geeks who grew up in a time of Microcomputers, IRC and BBS systems, becoming a digital pioneer in a new wild west web and falling through time one platform at a time. Join me gazing through the looking glass of an adventure spanning 40 years as we look to a new dawn of computing.

**Description**: "Living backwards!" Alice repeated in great astonishment. "I never heard of such a thing!"
"—but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways."
"I'm sure mine only works one way," Alice remarked. "I can't remember things before they happen."
"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards," the Queen remarked.
Rattling around in my rusty cranium are memories of computing years past; a million lines of code and mistakes aplenty across a varied career that prelude to a dozen possible futures. If there's one thing that I've learned it's that humans have a tendency to make the same mistakes over and over in new and interesting ways. I've lived through a few of the major events in recent computing history: from the dawn of the Internet, the rise of the Microcomputer, the invention of the world-wide-web, the dot-com bubble and the explosion of social media; but what lessons can we learn as a new generation takes over the console while the rest of us shuffle off into the end of line character?
