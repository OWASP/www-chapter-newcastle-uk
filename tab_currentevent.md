## Next Event

**03/12/2019** 1800 - 2100 (location tbc) - [sign up here](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Newcastle-Chapter/events/265874769/)

[Capture the flag](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Newcastle-Chapter/events/265874769/) event. Following on from the success of their recent Avalanche CTF, we've asked Pentest to build a brand new CTF for everyone to tackle at OWASP Newcastle. Avalanche 2, as they’re calling it, will still be based on a petition/campaign website like 38 degrees or the UK.gov, but promises to be bigger and better than the original, with a host of new challenges.

With assistance from our friends at Pentest Limited, we present to you Avalanche 2.

All levels of experience are welcome, starting from zero knowledge right up to experienced red teamer. All you need to do is bring yourself plus a laptop. You will learn something new, and if you don't you will have fun anyway! You can work alone or in a team.

If you’d like to have a go at the original Avalanche CTF you still can by visiting [https://pentest.co.uk/labs/avalanche-ctf/]([https://pentest.co.uk/labs/avalanche-ctf/])

As always, we will be providing pizza and drinks courtesy of our sponsors at Sage. If you have any dietary requirements please just message one of the organisers and we can make sure you're catered for.

Schedule:

* 1800 - 1815 - Arrival and networking
