Welcome to the official chapter page of the OWASP Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (UK) Chapter. We meet four times a year, usually on the last Tuesday of the month when we arrange meet-ups. Some of our previous talks are on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCssmNNN_3c7Ci6-ylFYQZjQ) channel.

We're always looking for speakers, we welcome anyone who is interested in presenting a talk. Whether you are new to the chapter or an existing member, we encourage you to reach out to one of our chapter leaders for more information on how to get involved. To help you along the way, we can also provide support with the preparation and delivery of your talk.

As we encourage knowledge sharing and raising awareness of our events and the topics covered, we also make the presentations available on our [previous events](#previousevents) page after each event.
