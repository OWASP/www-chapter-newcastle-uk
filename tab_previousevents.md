#### 03/12/2019

**Capture the flag event**

Following on from the success of their recent Avalanche CTF, we've asked Pentest to build a brand new CTF for everyone to tackle at OWASP Newcastle. Avalanche 2, as they’re calling it, will still be based on a petition/campaign website like 38 degrees or the UK.gov, but promises to be bigger and better than the original, with a host of new challenges.

With assistance from our friends at Pentest Limited, we present to you Avalanche 2.

All levels of experience are welcome, starting from zero knowledge right up to experienced red teamer. All you need to do is bring yourself plus a laptop. You will learn something new, and if you don't you will have fun anyway! You can work alone or in a team.

If you’d like to have a go at the original Avalanche CTF you still can by visiting [https://pentest.co.uk/labs/avalanche-ctf/]([https://pentest.co.uk/labs/avalanche-ctf/])

As always, we will be providing pizza and drinks courtesy of our sponsors at Sage. If you have any dietary requirements please just message one of the organisers and we can make sure you're catered for.

Schedule:

* 1800 - 1815 - Arrival and networking
* 1815 - 2100 - Avalanche 2 CTF
* 2100 - onwards Pub?

#### 23/09/2019

**Title**: [Stalk Awareness](presentations/2019-09-23-OWASP-Newcastle.pdf)

**Speaker**: [Cian](@nscrutables)

**Description**: We often focus on nation states and corporation's role in eroding our privacy and expanding omnipresent surveillance worldwide, meanwhile an entire niche industry that caters to regular consumers who want similar spying capabilities has slipped largely under the radar. Mobile apps that are designed to enable toxic and abusive behavior are being openly sold on the internet, marketed directly to abusers, these apps have come to be termed "stalkerware".

This talk will present analysis of the stalkerware industry, its products, marketing and the scope of the problem it represents, as well as potential solutions. I'll be examining these topics from both a technical and non-technical standpoint, based on many months of personal research.

For anyone considering certification as a route to success, self-improvement, or even just some thoughts on how I approached it. We’ll look at what I learned and how I learned it, including some tricks I picked up along the way to help cram information into my brain (and keep it there).

---

**26/06/2018**

We held our first CTF (Capture The Flag) event.

The CTF event was facilitated by Secarma. The attendees were split into groups, each group had their own sandboxed environment to connect into, and prizes were offered to the teams who captured the most flags.

**27/03/2018** 

**Title**: The Internet of (broken) things.

**Speaker**: Andi Pannell

**Description**: This talk will focus on the internet of things, how we’re connecting everything to the internet now, because why not add a WiFi connection to your Fridge? And how security is unlikely to be a consideration when making these products. I’ll also talk about DefCon, as last year my company sent a team of us to DefCon 25 in Las Vegas, explaining what DefCon is, what happens there, and how we won the IoT Village 0-day contest and I'll conclude with a live hacking demo.

**Title**: [An introduction to the OWASP automated threats to web applications](presentations/2018-03-27-AutomatedThreats-Newcastle-20180327.pptx)

**Speaker**: Colin Watson

**Description**: Web applications are subjected to unwanted automated usage – day in, day out. The vast majority of these events relate to misuse of inherent valid functionality, rather than the attempted exploitation of unmitigated vulnerabilities. Also, excessive misuse is often mistakenly reported as application denial-of-service (DoS) like HTTP-flooding, when in fact the DoS is a side-effect instead of the attacker’s primary intent.

**21/11/2017**

**Title**: [Explain hacking in ten minutes](presentations/2017-11-21-OWASPNCL_LG_21112017.pdf)

**Speaker**: Lorenzo Grespan

**Description**: Recently I had to show a 10-minute  "live hack" to a non-technical audience. As an introvert and a geek my main effort was in maintaining technical accuracy, however what made the audience go "aha!" turned out to be what for me was the least significant detail of the entire demo. In this talk I will show the hack, share the lessons learned and discuss how to communicate security concerns to non technical stakeholders, higher management and end users.

---

**Title**: [Building a Development Environment That's 'Secure Enough'](presentations/2017-11-21-Modern_DevOps_and_security.pptx)

**Speaker**: Robin Sillem

**19/09/2017**

**Title**: [Running a security event using OWASP Security Shepherd](presentations/2017-09-19-Security_Shepherd.pptx)

**Speaker**: Gareth Dixon

**Description**: In this talk I will cover running a security event using OWASP Security Shepherd. The event to be discussed was staged to promote engagement in a security initiative, understanding of security vulnerabilities and the application of knowledge to production services and applications. This talk will cover the project planning stage, through execution to the project retrospective. 

---

**Title**: [Enter the (Threat) Dragon](presentations/2017-09-19-Owasp_threat_dragon_201709_.pptx)

**Speaker**: Mike Goodwin

**Description**: Threat Modeling with OWASP Threat Dragon. Threat modelling is a great technique for hardening your application designs, but current tooling is a bit "crashy", limited to Windows or not free. OWASP Threat Dragon is an OWASP incubator project that aims to fix this and bring threat modeling to the masses. This talk is a tour round the tool, it's future road map and a look under it's hood. Mike the the project leader for Threat Dragon, so if you want to contribute, he would be very pleased to speak to you.

### 2016

---

**23/08/2016** 

**Title**: 50 Million Downloads and All I Got Was Malware

**Speaker**: [Andi Pannell](https://twitter.com/dr0idandy)

**Description**: How is it a free Android application that has been downloaded more times than WhatsApp can turn your phone into malware, sending your private data to China and inserting adverts? I’ll be discussing my journey of researching mobile malware and how you can too.

---

**Title**: [OWASP Cornucopia](presentations/2016-08-23-OwaspNCL-cornucopia-colinwatson.odp)

**Speaker**: Colin Watson

**Description**: OWASP Cornucopia is a free open-source card game, referenced by a PCI DSS information supplement, that helps derive application security requirements during the software development life cycle. This session will use an example eCommerce application to demonstrate how to utilise the card game. After an introduction and explanation, we will split into smaller groups to play the game gaining insights into relevant web application threats. The game is best played in groups of 4-6 with people who have a good knowledge of the application being assessed, and who have a mixture of backgrounds/experience - architects, developers, product owners, project managers, testers, etc, and those with software security responsibilities. Bring your colleagues along. Cornucopia is suitable for people aged 10 to 110 (decimal).

**24/11/2015**

**Title**: [The problems with proving identity](presentations/2015-11-24-OWASPNewcastle_the_problem_with_proving_identity.pptx)

**Speakers**: [Ben Lee](https://twitter.com/bibbleq) and [Ross Dargan](https://twitter.com/rossdargan)

**Description**: In this talk Ross and Ben will discuss the conundrum of proving (and more importantly verifying!) identity online. While both of these tasks might seem simple at first, they really aren't. This is a problem that people have grappled with since the beginning of communications (okay so not the online part!) and we still don't have all the answers. The talk will cover among other things; Twitter, wax seals (!), hashing, certificates and much more…* (*Talk may not be historically accurate! ;))

---

**Title**: [Think about the Top 10 Controls, not the Top 10 Risks](presentations/2015-11-24-Owaspnewcastle-snakesandladders.pptx)

**Speaker**: Colin Watson

**Description**: The OWASP Top 10 is the most well-known OWASP project, but how can awareness of OWASP guidance for developers be improved? In this presentation Colin Watson will describe a board game that encourages developers to think and learn about the most important web application security controls, rather than risks or vulnerabilities. Take a copy of the game away with you - it is suitable for developers of all sizes. 

---

**Title**: [Automated Security Testing Using The ZAP API](presentations/2015-11-24-OWASPNewcastle_automated_security_testing_using_ZAP_API.pptx)

---

**Title**: [Real world defence in depth (part 1)](presentations/2015-11-24-Owaspnewcastle-real_world_defence_in_depth.pptx)

**Speaker**: Mike Goodwin

**Description**: Everyone should be aiming for defence in depth, but what does it actually mean to an application developer? This is the first of a series of short talks about real world scenarios where defence in depth is genuinely useful and easily achievable. It should help you turn defence in depth from an aspiration into practical reality.

**Speaker**: Neil Dixley

**Description**: The psychology of software engineering. An introduction to the psychology of cognitive bias and how human nature and cognitive biases are the key to user based security vulnerabilities. A look at how our brains trick us into feeling safe while giving our pin number to strangers on the phone plus a look at how we can use technology to disrupt cognitive bias and use these human traits to mitigate threats and strengthen application security.

---

**Title**: [Security Compliance for Developers - Are we Certified... or Certifiable?](presentations/2015-03-24-OWASP_Compliance_for_Devs.pptx)

**Speaker**: Andy Ward

**Description**: Against a background of increasing threats and hacks, with more and more of our personal lives and business processes conducted online, it's never been more important to ensure our software is secure and robust. But how do you prove it? These days, reassuring your customers takes more than an SSL padlock, and some marketing spiel mentioning 'banking grade encryption'! After a quick reminder of "what's the worst that can happen...", Andy will introduce some of the security Compliance and Certification systems that help you 'walk the walk', and provide confidence that your system has its security in good hands, before looking at what it means for developers and engineering teams.
