#### **21/09/2023** - Joint meetup with DevOpsNorthEast

Title: Driving the most out of DAST

**Speaker**: Simon Gurney

**Speaker Bio**: Simon is one of the Punk Security Co-Founders and has over 15 years experience working within IT, primarily focused on automation and InfoSec.

Simon has a wealth of experience and approaches DevOps from an infrastructure background, but is a keen Python and .NET CORE developer. He has authored two open source projects, pwnSpoof and SMBeagle.

Talk Synopsis: Unlike SAST and IAST, DAST can be a difficult tool to implement and configure in DevSecOps pipelines. In this session, we will explore why this is and what the real prerequisites are to getting meaningful results from DAST tooling.

Simon will explore a few different DAST tools, including ZAP, and discuss how using functional testing scripts can help navigate your apps and drive out DAST findings.

### 2022

---

#### **25/10/2022**

**Title**: Anti-Anti-Virus: An Introduction to Evasion

**Speaker**: Ben Harvey

**Speaker Bio**: Ben is a specialist within Sage’s Offensive Security team. His role is to emulate attackers in order to highlight vulnerabilities within Sage’s products or infrastructure. This may involve penetration tests of web applications, creating convincing phishing emails or deploying ‘ransomware’ across Sage’s network – all to inform and improve defences.

**Description**: OK so you’ve taken the bait. You’ve been convinced by the email; you’ve opened the attachment and you’ve enabled the macros. Then, nothing. Nothing happened. Until three hours later, when you receive an MFA alert, but you didn’t log in… We know what phishing looks like, and we know it’s dangerous, but what happens when you enable those macros? Join us as we look ‘under the hood’ of a phishing payload. We’ll look at how attackers get their code to run and techniques they’ll use to evade defences. Finally, we’ll ask ourselves the question – what’s the point in Anti-Virus then?

---

**Title**: An Unorthodox Method Of Achieving Persistence On iOS

**Speaker**: James Duffy

**Speaker Bio**: James is a security researcher, reverse engineer and author. His main platform of interest is iOS.

**Description**: In this talk we’ll discuss techniques that will result in persistent code execution on iOS without any requirement for a jailbreak subsystem.

---

#### **19/05/2022**


**Title**: Vehicle Cybersecurity: Every cloud has a silver lining..

**Speaker**: Dani Walsh

**Speaker Bio**: Dani led the class of 2015 achieving a first-class degree in Ethical Hacking for Computer Security from Northumbria University; where she also attained the Certified Ethical Hacker professional security status. The door opened into a software engineering role with Sevcon, later acquired by BorgWarner. Traversing through a career in embedded software engineering she has returned to her natural habitat of product cyber security management and engineering. She has progressed from Software Intern through to Global Cybersecurity Manager developing the foundation for Product Cybersecurity and the secure development within Borgwarner. For Dani, it’s not all about work - she is a leading light in STEM for the Northeast England helping to inspire the younger generation into pursuing STEM careers by running local code clubs.

**Description**: Pre-warming seats, remote keyless entry, heated steering wheels, refrigerated glove boxes... we've come a long way in the automotive industry to bring the best experience for road users however gimmicky they may seem. These features come at a price and we're not just talking about money. The cybersecurity demands are now increasing exponentially for the vehicle OEMS and their suppliers because of today's feature-rich vehicles. A typical new vehicle has on average 100 million lines of code and with it brings potential zero-day and accidental vulnerabilities. The cybersecurity challenge in the modern vehicle is proportional to the size of the codebase- cybersecurity management is a daunting task. Cybersecurity is a major topic for almost every digital domain and with this, we can look to our fellow cybersecurity practitioners for guidance and inspiration for our own challenges.
This presentation investigates the cross-over of web security lessons learnt and embedded security. What can we leverage? What should we ignore? OWASP Top 10 in an ECU? Well let's find out...

**Title**: Attack mitigation and incident response

**Speaker**: Adam Bell

**Speaker Bio**: My name is Adam Bell, I live in Washington, Tyne & Wear with my fiancée and 4 children. I’m a mature student at Northumbria University, Newcastle just about to finish my final year in Computer & Digital Forensics. I’m very passionate about data security and computer forensics. I’ve previously worked for large organizations in sales backgrounds. I worked for T-Mobile / EE for 9 years before leaving that job to go to university in 2015 starting a foundation degree then leading onto this degree. In the middle of my degree I’ve gone through a separation and divorce resulting in having to repeat first and second year. On the bright side I’ve learned more than a student doing 3 years would learn due to the course I study evolving over the years. I’m also a course rep for my course representing the students at faculty meetings. I’ve recently completed an accreditation with Microsoft in AI Fundamentals. I’m currently working towards my CHFI (Computer Hacker Forensics Investigator) accreditation with EC council. In my spare time in studies, I’m studying penetration testing.
In my spare time I love to spend the time with my family, I play football once a week and train in Japanese jujitsu twice a week. I enjoy going to the cinema with my friends. I regularly play on my PS5 on any free evenings I have. I absolutely love technology also wanting the latest gadgets.

**Description**: Cyber security is a rather large area within data security, that and digital forensics are two sides of the same coin. Although I do study digital forensics, I’m still very interested in the cyber security side and preventing a breach rather than needing to investigate it. The area I will be talking and presenting about is incident response.

* Preparation
* Detection & Analysis
* Containment, eradication, and recovery
* Post incident activity.

I will also be covering the methods to reduce the likelihood of attack also.

#### **25/05/2021**

**Title**: B@ck 2 BaS!c5: OWASP Top 10

**Speaker**: Security Queens 

**Speaker Bios**: 

**Sarah**: Hey! I'm Sarah, a recent graduate from Bournemouth University. I studied Forensic Computing and Security and graduated last year. During my final year I was Vice President of the cyber security society, however also got stuck into the security community by attending conferences (my first one was with Sophia, and I got to watch her talk in 2018), where I ended up speaking on and winning the rookie track in 2019. From there I went on to run my first workshop at G3C, run the Bournemouth 2600 chapter and then become a content creator for Security Queens! I am now a junior security consultant at NCC.

**Sophia**: Hello! I'm Sophia, also a recent graduate from Bournemouth University. I studied a BSc in Cyber Security Management and graduated at the same time as Sarah! I was President of the cyber security society, with Sarah as my trusty VP. Since my security journey started circum-2017, I've done a few bits and bobs... I've represented the UK three times at the European Cyber Security Challenge, and was appointed Team Captain in 2019. I was also on the Channel 4 TV show Hunted as a cyber hunter, and similar to Sarah have dabbled in the conference circuit delivering a few talks here and there! I've also (somehow) bagged a few awards, such as Cybersecurity Student of the Year and Highly Acclaimed Rising Star - but most importantly, I now run Security Queens with Sarah and have started my first industry job as a security consultant and penetration tester at NCC.

**Description**: Be it an OWASP meet, we wanted to go back to basics and run through the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. Since we are both new to the industry we wanted to talk about something we have currently been learning about! For this talk we have decided to explain each vulnerability and walkthrough a challenge for each one. (Please pray to the demo gods for us). Since we are still newbies we wanted to finish off our talk with some time to open up the floor to questions and or discussions, so feel free to pitch in with neat tricks, techniques or tools you might use when faced up against these vulns yourself. We hope you enjoy! The Queens.

**Title**: Adventures in Out-of-Band Exploitation

**Speaker**: Holly Grace

**Bio**: Holly Grace has fourteen years of experience in leading information security teams. She holds a Master’s degree in Information Security from Cardiff University. Her early career was spent in the military working in roles such as Site Security Officer, although she now works with a wide range of organisations delivering information security testing. She is the Founder and technical lead for Akimbo Core, leading both the development of the software platform as well as leading the security testing capability. She is also the Managing Director of Secarma, a cybersecurity consultancy focused on Penetration Testing.

**Description**: Out-of-Band exploitation is an often-overlooked method of exploiting vulnerabilities, speeding up exploitation of blind issues, and bypassing protection mechanisms. It’s a useful technique for attackers to improve their exploitation capability, but there are also some key “your logs are lying to you” lessons for defenders. In this talk we’ll look at it as an exploitation method for web vulnerabilities, as well as give an example of where it can be used to exfiltrate data from hardened internal networks.

#### **23/02/2021**

**Title**: [Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep](presentations/2021-02-23-semgrep.pdf)

**Speaker**: [Colleen Dai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-dai-839376b4) 

**Bio**: Colleen Dai is a security software engineer at r2c, a startup working on building static analysis tools that focus on precision and being custom-fit to the consumer. At r2c, Colleen has worked on the language parsing along with AST matching. She is also writing rules to find security vulnerabilities in open source code. Colleen recently received her B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Statistics from Stanford. She regularly enjoys Brazilian Jiujitsu, drawing, and trying (and failing) not to eat everything in her fridge.

**Description**: We’ll discuss a program analysis tool we’re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple “grep-like” interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep’s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He’s now full time with us at r2c.

Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we’ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.

For example, find subprocess calls with shell=True in Python using the query:

`subprocess.open(..., shell=True)`

This will even find snippets like:

```import subprocess as s
s.open(f'rm {args}', shell=True)
```

Or find hardcoded credentials using the query:

`boto3.client(..., aws_secret_access_key=”...”, aws_access_key_id=”...” )`

**Title**: Alice Through the Cyber Looking Glass

**Speaker**: [Rick Trotter](https://twitter.com/the_gingercoder)

**Bio**: Rick Trotter is one of the last Generation-X geeks who grew up in a time of Microcomputers, IRC and BBS systems, becoming a digital pioneer in a new wild west web and falling through time one platform at a time. Join me gazing through the looking glass of an adventure spanning 40 years as we look to a new dawn of computing.

**Description**: "Living backwards!" Alice repeated in great astonishment. "I never heard of such a thing!"
"—but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways."
"I'm sure mine only works one way," Alice remarked. "I can't remember things before they happen."
"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards," the Queen remarked.
Rattling around in my rusty cranium are memories of computing years past; a million lines of code and mistakes aplenty across a varied career that prelude to a dozen possible futures. If there's one thing that I've learned it's that humans have a tendency to make the same mistakes over and over in new and interesting ways. I've lived through a few of the major events in recent computing history: from the dawn of the Internet, the rise of the Microcomputer, the invention of the world-wide-web, the dot-com bubble and the explosion of social media; but what lessons can we learn as a new generation takes over the console while the rest of us shuffle off into the end of line character?

#### 23/09/2019

**Title**: [Stalk Awareness](presentations/2019-09-23-OWASP-Newcastle.pdf)

**Speaker**: [Cian](@nscrutables)

**Description**: We often focus on nation states and corporation's role in eroding our privacy and expanding omnipresent surveillance worldwide, meanwhile an entire niche industry that caters to regular consumers who want similar spying capabilities has slipped largely under the radar. Mobile apps that are designed to enable toxic and abusive behavior are being openly sold on the internet, marketed directly to abusers, these apps have come to be termed "stalkerware".

This talk will present analysis of the stalkerware industry, its products, marketing and the scope of the problem it represents, as well as potential solutions. I'll be examining these topics from both a technical and non-technical standpoint, based on many months of personal research.

**Title**: [An introduction to the OWASP automated threats to web applications](presentations/2018-03-27-AutomatedThreats-Newcastle-20180327.pptx)

**Speaker**: Colin Watson

**Description**: Web applications are subjected to unwanted automated usage – day in, day out. The vast majority of these events relate to misuse of inherent valid functionality, rather than the attempted exploitation of unmitigated vulnerabilities. Also, excessive misuse is often mistakenly reported as application denial-of-service (DoS) like HTTP-flooding, when in fact the DoS is a side-effect instead of the attacker’s primary intent.

**Title**: [Explain hacking in ten minutes](presentations/2017-11-21-OWASPNCL_LG_21112017.pdf)

**Speaker**: Lorenzo Grespan

**Description**: Recently I had to show a 10-minute  "live hack" to a non-technical audience. As an introvert and a geek my main effort was in maintaining technical accuracy, however what made the audience go "aha!" turned out to be what for me was the least significant detail of the entire demo. In this talk I will show the hack, share the lessons learned and discuss how to communicate security concerns to non technical stakeholders, higher management and end users.

**Title**: [Enter the (Threat) Dragon](presentations/2017-09-19-Owasp_threat_dragon_201709_.pptx)

**Speaker**: Mike Goodwin

**Description**: Threat Modeling with OWASP Threat Dragon. Threat modelling is a great technique for hardening your application designs, but current tooling is a bit "crashy", limited to Windows or not free. OWASP Threat Dragon is an OWASP incubator project that aims to fix this and bring threat modeling to the masses. This talk is a tour round the tool, it's future road map and a look under it's hood. Mike the the project leader for Threat Dragon, so if you want to contribute, he would be very pleased to speak to you.

**Title**: 50 Million Downloads and All I Got Was Malware

**Speaker**: [Andi Pannell](https://twitter.com/dr0idandy)

**Description**: How is it a free Android application that has been downloaded more times than WhatsApp can turn your phone into malware, sending your private data to China and inserting adverts? I’ll be discussing my journey of researching mobile malware and how you can too.

**Title**: [OWASP Cornucopia](presentations/2016-08-23-OwaspNCL-cornucopia-colinwatson.odp)

**Speaker**: Colin Watson

**Description**: OWASP Cornucopia is a free open-source card game, referenced by a PCI DSS information supplement, that helps derive application security requirements during the software development life cycle. This session will use an example eCommerce application to demonstrate how to utilise the card game. After an introduction and explanation, we will split into smaller groups to play the game gaining insights into relevant web application threats. The game is best played in groups of 4-6 with people who have a good knowledge of the application being assessed, and who have a mixture of backgrounds/experience - architects, developers, product owners, project managers, testers, etc, and those with software security responsibilities. Bring your colleagues along. Cornucopia is suitable for people aged 10 to 110 (decimal).

**Title**: [The problems with proving identity](presentations/2015-11-24-OWASPNewcastle_the_problem_with_proving_identity.pptx)

**Speakers**: [Ben Lee](https://twitter.com/bibbleq) and [Ross Dargan](https://twitter.com/rossdargan)

**Description**: In this talk Ross and Ben will discuss the conundrum of proving (and more importantly verifying!) identity online. While both of these tasks might seem simple at first, they really aren't. This is a problem that people have grappled with since the beginning of communications (okay so not the online part!) and we still don't have all the answers. The talk will cover among other things; Twitter, wax seals (!), hashing, certificates and much more…* (*Talk may not be historically accurate! ;))

**Title**: [Think about the Top 10 Controls, not the Top 10 Risks](presentations/2015-11-24-Owaspnewcastle-snakesandladders.pptx)

**Speaker**: Colin Watson

**Description**: The OWASP Top 10 is the most well-known OWASP project, but how can awareness of OWASP guidance for developers be improved? In this presentation Colin Watson will describe a board game that encourages developers to think and learn about the most important web application security controls, rather than risks or vulnerabilities. Take a copy of the game away with you - it is suitable for developers of all sizes.

**Title**: [Real world defence in depth (part 1)](presentations/2015-11-24-Owaspnewcastle-real_world_defence_in_depth.pptx)

**Speaker**: Mike Goodwin

**Description**: Everyone should be aiming for defence in depth, but what does it actually mean to an application developer? This is the first of a series of short talks about real world scenarios where defence in depth is genuinely useful and easily achievable. It should help you turn defence in depth from an aspiration into practical reality.

**Title**: [Cognitive Bias and Security Vulnerabilities](presentations/2015-03-24-Cognitive_Bias_and_Security_Vulnerabilities_Presentation.pptx/)

**Speaker**: Neil Dixley

**Description**: The psychology of software engineering. An introduction to the psychology of cognitive bias and how human nature and cognitive biases are the key to user based security vulnerabilities. A look at how our brains trick us into feeling safe while giving our pin number to strangers on the phone plus a look at how we can use technology to disrupt cognitive bias and use these human traits to mitigate threats and strengthen application security.

**Title**: [Security Compliance for Developers - Are we Certified... or Certifiable?](presentations/2015-03-24-OWASP_Compliance_for_Devs.pptx)

**Speaker**: Andy Ward

**Description**: Against a background of increasing threats and hacks, with more and more of our personal lives and business processes conducted online, it's never been more important to ensure our software is secure and robust. But how do you prove it? These days, reassuring your customers takes more than an SSL padlock, and some marketing spiel mentioning 'banking grade encryption'! After a quick reminder of "what's the worst that can happen...", Andy will introduce some of the security Compliance and Certification systems that help you 'walk the walk', and provide confidence that your system has its security in good hands, before looking at what it means for developers and engineering teams.
